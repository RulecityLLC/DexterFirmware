mutators:
 - cxx_init_const
 - cxx_bitwise_assignment
 - cxx_arithmetic_assignment
 - cxx_pre_inc_to_pre_dec # removed cxx_post_inc_to_post_dec because I am using that as a shortcut to make a bool-like byte non-zero
 - cxx_decrement
 - cxx_arithmetic
 - cxx_comparison
 - cxx_boundary
 - cxx_bitwise
 - cxx_remove_void_call # removed cxx_replace_scalar_call because it was replacing the call with 42 which was equivalent to non-zero so it didn't help me
excludePaths: # support regex
 - gtest
 - gmock
 - tests.cpp # any file ending in *tests.cpp is excluded
timeout: 10000 # 10 seconds
